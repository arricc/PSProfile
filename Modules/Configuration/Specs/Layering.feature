Feature: Multiple settings files should layer
    As a module author, I want to distribute a default config with my module so that by default it has settings
    As a machine administrator, I want to save corporate defaults so that users start with the right configuration
    As a user I want to save my own preferences because those other guys are frequently wrong
    And our custom settings shouldn't be overwritten on upgrade

    Background:
        Given the configuration module is imported with testing paths:
        | Enterprise                | User                | Machine                |
        | TestDrive:/EnterprisePath | TestDrive:/UserPath | TestDrive:/MachinePath |
